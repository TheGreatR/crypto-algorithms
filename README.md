Some Basic network security encryption and decryption algorithms.

Hi fellas, I'm TheGreatR. I'm a tech enthusiastic who don't know yet how to get into the ocean of open source codes. Thought this would be a better start then thinking and doing nothing. This is my first project so some suggestions on optimisations of code would be very helpful.  I would be very greatful. Thank you,
